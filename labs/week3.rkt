; 3. Modify the cc procedure so that its kinds-of-coins parameter, instead of being an integer, is a
; sentence that contains the values of the coins to be used in making change. The coins should be tried in the
; sequence they appear in the sentence. For the count-change procedure to work the same in the revised
; program as in the original, it should call cc as follows:
; (define (count-change amount)
; (cc amount â€™(50 25 10 5 1)) )

(define (count-change2 amount)
  (define (cc amount kinds-of-coins)
